If you've ever used Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab then most of the concepts will be familiar to you with some (major) differences.</p><h3>What is Slogidex?</h3><p>Slogidex is an evironment for writing and executing processes inspired by the concept of gradual automation. It's pretty simple: formalize a process into discrete steps, then try to replace steps with automated scripts. If you can't, that's fine, just outlining the process can already be helpful for remembering tasks, onboarding team members, or working through harder problems.</p><p>The point of Slogidex is to make <em>that</em> process easier with</p><ul><li><p>A unified GUI for managing processes</p></li><li><p>Components for defining processes; like rich text blocks, code blocks, and forms</p></li><li><p>Embedded script execution</p></li><li><p>Instancing and progress tracking</p></li></ul><p>Whether you're doing<strong> operations</strong>, <strong>system administration</strong>, or just <strong>tinkering</strong>, there's probably something you'd like to automate or simplify.</p>"
