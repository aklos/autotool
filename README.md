Gradual automation platform for individuals and businesses. Automating everything is hard, instead write guides and replace steps with scripts gradually.

## Development

Run `yarn tauri dev`

https://tauri.app/

## Notes

- Set UID of scripts: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/suid-and-std-process-bug/29058/2
- Named args in bash: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/129391/passing-named-arguments-to-shell-scripts
- Text editor should look and work like Notion's.
