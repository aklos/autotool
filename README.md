Autotool, or "Automation tool", is a desktop application for writing and executing processes inspired by the concept of gradual automation. It's pretty simple: formalize a process into discrete steps, then try to replace some of the steps with automated scripts.

The point of Autotool is to make *that* process easier with

- A unified environment for managing processes
- Components for defining processes; like rich text blocks, code blocks, and forms
- Embedded script execution

Whether you're doing **devops**, **business operations**, **system administration**, or just **tinkering**, there's probably something you'd like to automate or simplify.
